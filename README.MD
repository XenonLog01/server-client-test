Client / Server Test
===

This is a project to create a simple client/server system with python, 
which I can use in future projects. Eventually, I would like to get this 
to the point where I can begin using it in simple games, primarily so that
I can better educate myself on how servers work, and how they handle 
transactions. For now it is written in python, and although I have no 
intentions of rewriting it in say, Go, I will likely end up re-writing it
to clean up old code.

Packages:
---

This project depends on 2 primary libraries. Both are available using 
the pip package manager. They are:

 * `urllib3`
 * `pydotenv`

Todo:
---

 * Update the HEAD request handler.
 * Improve responses for GET and POST requests.
 * Improve error handling both client and server side.
