Server Test
---

This is a project to create a simple client/server system with python, 
which I can use in future projects. Eventually, I would like to get this 
to the point where I can begin using it in simple games, primarily so that
I can better educate myself on how servers work, and how they handle 
transactions. For now it is written in python, and although I have no 
intentions of rewriting it in say, Go, I will likely end up re-writing it
to clean up old code.
